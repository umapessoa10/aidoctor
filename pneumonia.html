            <h2>Introduction to Pneumonia</h2>
            <p>Pneumonia is an inflammatory condition of the lung primarily affecting the microscopic air sacs known as alveoli. Typically caused by infections due to bacteria, viruses, or fungi, it is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Symptoms can range from mild to severe and include coughing, fever, chills, and difficulty breathing. The impact of pneumonia is particularly severe in children under five and in the elderly, but it can affect individuals of all ages.</p>

        <div class="mb-4">
            <h2>Bacterial Pneumonia</h2>
            <p>The most common form of pneumonia is bacterial pneumonia, with Streptococcus pneumoniae being the most prevalent cause. It usually occurs when the body's immune system is weakened due to illness, malnutrition, or age. The symptoms often come on more suddenly and are more severe compared to other forms of pneumonia. Vaccination and appropriate antibiotic treatment are key strategies in managing and preventing bacterial pneumonia.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="mb-4 highlight">
            <h2>Viral Pneumonia</h2>
            <p>Viral pneumonia, commonly caused by influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and recently by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), presents with symptoms similar to bacterial pneumonia but usually milder. However, it can be particularly dangerous in immunocompromised individuals. Preventative measures like vaccinations and good hygiene practices play a crucial role in controlling its spread.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="mb-4">
            <h2>Fungal Pneumonia</h2>
            <p>Fungal pneumonia is less common and often affects individuals with compromised immune systems, such as HIV/AIDS patients. It can be caused by a variety of fungi, including those found in soil or bird droppings. Diagnosis and treatment of fungal pneumonia can be complex and typically require specialized medical care.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="mb-4 highlight">
            <h2>Community-Acquired vs. Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia</h2>
            <p>Pneumonia is classified based on where it's acquired: community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). CAP is contracted outside of hospital settings and is usually less severe, while HAP occurs in hospitals or long-term care facilities and can be more resistant to antibiotics, making it more challenging to treat.</p>

            <h2>Global Initiatives and Challenges</h2>
            <p>Pneumonia poses a significant burden on public health systems worldwide. It is a leading cause of hospitalization in many countries and results in substantial healthcare costs. The illness also has a profound impact on the workforce, education, and overall productivity, as it often requires extended periods of rest and recovery.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="mb-4 highlight">
            <h2>Prevention Strategies</h2>
            <p>Preventative strategies are essential in reducing the incidence of pneumonia. These include vaccinations, such as the pneumococcal and flu vaccines, which are particularly important for high-risk groups. Improving indoor air quality, promoting good hygiene, and discouraging smoking are also critical in preventing pneumonia.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="mb-4">
            <h2>Treatment Approaches</h2>
            <p>Treatment of pneumonia typically involves antibiotics for bacterial cases, antiviral drugs for viral pneumonia, or antifungal medication for fungal infections. Oxygen therapy and respiratory support may be required in severe cases. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment are key factors in improving outcomes.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="mb-4 highlight">
            <h2>Conclusion and Future Directions</h2>
            <p>While significant progress has been made in understanding and treating pneumonia, it remains a critical public health issue. Ongoing research, public health initiatives, and international cooperation are essential in the fight against pneumonia. With continued focus on prevention, diagnosis, and treatment, it is possible to reduce the impact of pneumonia on global health significantly..</p>
